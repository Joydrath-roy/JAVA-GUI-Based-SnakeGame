# JAVA-GUI-Based-SnakeGame
Project Title : GUI Based SnakeGame.
Summary : In this project, I have done a grid-based snake game where some
sort of features will follow such as snake can not go outside the grid and
don't clash with itself. It just eats food that randomly appears on the grid.
And by eating fruits it gets bigger.
Implementation : Java, Java AWT library.
